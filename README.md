# Illuminationd

Illuminationd provides a DBUS interface to configure the various Illumination devices
possibly connected to your Linux desktop.

Any other operating systems are currently not supported. Pull Requests are
welcome though.

## Why illumination?

First off, there is already a _Lightsd_ in the wild.
Thus naming it along these lines would make it incredibly hard to search and find the correct
GitHub issues, etc.
Also currently the focus is on devices that provide "ambient" lighting/illumination.
Hopefully the more narrow name makes this focus clear.
